/**
 * Unit test for the hard-deadline force-resolve in createLocalBashOperations.
 *
 * A true D-state (uninterruptible-sleep) child never emits `close`/`exit` even
 * after SIGKILL, so `await waitForChildProcess(child)` would hang the sync bash
 * path forever. The graceful-kill ladder sends the signals but cannot
 * force-resolve the awaiting caller — the hard deadline must live in the caller.
 *
 * Reproducing a real D-state portably is impractical, so we simulate the exact
 * symptom (child never closes before the deadline) deterministically: a
 * SIGTERM-ignoring child combined with a LARGE killGraceMs (so the SIGKILL
 * escalation never fires inside the test window) and a SHORT forceResolveDelayMs.
 * The child therefore stays open past the hard deadline, forcing the caller to
 * force-resolve — proving the no-hang guarantee and the (force-killed) marker.
