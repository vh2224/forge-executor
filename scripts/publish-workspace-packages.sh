# Publishes every publishable @opengsd workspace package to npm, in dependency
# order, at the current root package.json version. The package list is derived
# from scripts/lib/npm-release-packages.cjs (driven by each package's
# publishConfig) — NOT a hardcoded list — so a new publishable package can never
# be silently forgotten the way @opengsd/cloud-mcp-gateway and @opengsd/daemon
# were.
#
# Assumes the build already ran and prepack has resolved workspace: ranges
# (callers run scripts/prepack-resolve-workspace.cjs + the postpack restore trap).
# Idempotent: a package already published at this version is skipped.
#
# Env:
#   TAG_FLAG        extra npm publish flags (e.g. "--tag latest"); optional
#   NODE_AUTH_TOKEN npm auth token for the token-auth fallback; optional (OIDC default)
