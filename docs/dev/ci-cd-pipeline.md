# CI/CD Pipeline Guide

## Overview

GSD 2 uses a three-stage promotion pipeline that automatically moves merged PRs through **Dev → Test → Prod** environments using npm dist-tags.

```
PR merged to main
        │
        ▼
   ┌─────────┐    ci.yml passes (build, test, typecheck)
   │   DEV   │    → publishes gsd-pi@<version>-dev.<sha> with @dev tag
   └────┬────┘
        ▼ (automatic if green)
   ┌─────────┐    CLI smoke tests + LLM fixture replay
   │  TEST   │    → promotes to @next tag
   └────┬────┘    → pushes Docker image as :next
        ▼ (manual approval required)
   ┌─────────┐    optional real-LLM integration tests
   │  PROD   │    → promotes to @latest tag
   └─────────┘    → creates GitHub Release
```

## For Contributors: Testing Your PR Before It Ships

### Install the Dev Build

Every merged PR is immediately installable:

```bash
# Latest dev build (bleeding edge, every merged PR)
npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@dev

# Test candidate (passed smoke + fixture tests)
npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@next

# Stable production release
npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest    # or just: npx @opengsd/gsd-pi
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Test candidate
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/open-gsd/gsd-pi:next --version

# Stable
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/open-gsd/gsd-pi:latest --version
```

### Checking if a Fix Landed

1. Find the PR's merge commit SHA (first 7 chars)
2. Check if it's in `@dev`: `npm view @opengsd/gsd-pi@dev version`
   - If the version ends in `-dev.<your-sha>`, your PR is in dev
3. Check if it promoted to `@next`: `npm view @opengsd/gsd-pi@next version`
4. Check if it's in production: `npm view @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest version`

## For Maintainers

### Pipeline Workflows

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| CI | `ci.yml` | PR + push to main | Build, test, typecheck — **gate for all promotions** |
| NPM Publish | `npm-publish.yml` | Manual dispatch | Publish approved `@dev` and `@next` releases; for `@latest`, publish and verify `@dev` first, then wait for Prod approval |
| Release Pipeline | `pipeline.yml` | After CI succeeds on main | Three-stage promotion |
| Native Binaries | `build-native.yml` | `v*` tags | Cross-compile platform binaries |
| Dev Cleanup | `cleanup-dev-versions.yml` | Weekly (Monday 06:00 UTC) | Unpublish `-dev.` versions older than 30 days |
| Agent Workflow Guard | `agent-workflow-guard.yml` | PR changes to workflow files | Blocks workflow diffs that expand `allowed_non_write_users` |
| AI Triage | `ai-triage.yml` | Issues: opened/edited/reopened; PRs: opened/reopened; trusted `issue_comment` with `/rerun-triage` | Automated classification (not on every push) |
| Issue Dedupe | `issue-dedupe.yml` | Opened/edited/reopened issues + manual dispatch | Posts likely duplicate candidates once per issue |
| Issue Lifecycle | `issue-lifecycle.yml` | Label changes + schedule + manual dispatch | Adds lifecycle guidance comments and sweeps stale `needs-info` issues |

**CI optimization:** GitHub Actions minutes were reduced ~60-70% (~10k → ~3-4k/month) through workflow consolidation and caching improvements.

**CI refactor (2026-05):** Single `fast-gates` job, Linux build/test consolidation, path-gated Windows/Docker checks, and coverage moved out of the core CI path. Local parity: `verify:fast`, `verify:pr` (fast loop), **`verify:merge`** (PR blocking). See [Test confidence stack](./test-confidence-stack.md).

**Pipeline optimization:**
- **Shallow clones** — downstream jobs use shallow checkout + shared build artifacts
- **npm cache in pipeline** — prerelease verification and production release use `cache: 'npm'` on setup-node, saving ~1-2 min per job on repeat runs
- **Exponential backoff** — npm registry propagation waits in `build-native.yml` replaced hardcoded `sleep 30` + fixed 15s retries with exponential backoff (5s → 10s → 20s → 30s cap), typically finishing in <15s when the registry is fast
- **Security hardening** — pipeline.yml moved `${{ }}` expressions from `run:` blocks to `env:` variables to prevent command injection vectors

### CI job tiers

See [Test confidence stack](./test-confidence-stack.md) for the code-area → runner → local command map.

| Tier | Job(s) | When | Blocks merge? |
|------|--------|------|---------------|
| Fast gates | `fast-gates` | Every PR/push (secrets, docs injection, skill refs, PR policy, tier-map drift) | Yes |
| Build + Linux tests | `build` | `heavy-code-changed=true` — compile, package validation, unit/package/integration/e2e tests with one install | Yes |
| Coverage | `Coverage report` workflow | Manual, weekly schedule, or PR labeled `coverage` | Separate workflow |
| Platform | Docker e2e step in `build`, `windows-portability` | Path-gated; Docker runs only when `docker-changed=true`, Windows runs only when portability paths change | Yes when triggered |
| Platform (warn) | Windows e2e smoke step inside `windows-portability` | `windows-e2e-changed=true` | **No** (`continue-on-error: true`) |

**Local before review:** `npm run verify:merge` — sequential parity with PR blocking jobs above (except path-gated platform jobs).

**Branch protection:** Required checks should include `fast-gates` and `build` for full Linux merge confidence. Keep `windows-portability` required only if GitHub branch protection is configured to handle skipped path-gated checks correctly.

### Build-Relevant Change Detection

`scripts/ci-classify-changes.sh` (run inside `fast-gates`) classifies the diff before expensive jobs run.

- **Skipped when doc/metadata only:** `build`, Linux test steps, Docker e2e, `windows-portability`
- **Still runs:** `fast-gates` (all security and policy scans)
- **`web-changed`:** reserved for future path gating (web host always builds in `build` because `validate-pack` requires `dist/web/standalone/server.js`)

### Prompt Injection Scan

`fast-gates` runs `scripts/docs-prompt-injection-scan.sh` against the PR merge base (`CI_DIFF_REF`, not hardcoded `origin/main`). It scans documentation prose (excluding fenced code blocks) for patterns that could manipulate LLM behavior when docs are ingested as context:

- **System prompt markers** — `<system-prompt>`, `<|im_start|>system`, `[SYSTEM]:`
- **Role/instruction overrides** — `ignore previous instructions`, `you are now`, `new instructions:`
- **Hidden HTML directives** — `<!-- PROMPT:`, `<!-- INSTRUCTION:`
- **Tool call injection** — `<tool_call>`, `<function_call>`, `<invoke`
- **Invisible Unicode** — zero-width character sequences that hide directives

Content inside fenced code blocks (` ``` `) is excluded — patterns in code examples are expected and legitimate.

**False positives:** Add exceptions to `.prompt-injection-scanignore` using the same format as `.secretscanignore` (one pattern per line, `file:regex` for file-scoped exceptions).

### Gating Tests

The pipeline only triggers after `ci.yml` passes. Key gating tests include:

- **Unit tests** (`npm run test:unit`) — includes `auto-session-encapsulation.test.ts` which enforces that all auto-mode state is encapsulated in `AutoSession`, plus dispatch loop regression tests that exercise the full `deriveState → resolveDispatch → idempotency` chain without an LLM. Any PR adding module-level mutable state to `auto.ts` will fail CI and block the pipeline.
- **Integration tests** (`npm run test:integration`)
- **E2E tests** (`npm run test:e2e`)
- **Extension typecheck** (`npm run typecheck:extensions`)
- **Package validation** (`npm run validate-pack`)
- **Smoke tests** (`npm run test:smoke`) — run post-build in the pipeline against the local binary and again against the globally-installed `@dev` package
- **Live regression tests** (`npm run test:live-regression`) — run against the installed binary in the Test stage to catch runtime regressions before promotion to `@next`

### Approving a Prod Release

1. A version reaches the Test stage automatically
2. In GitHub Actions, run **NPM Publish** with `channel=latest`; the workflow publishes and verifies `@dev` from `main`, then plans the release, builds all five native binaries, and the `prod-release` job will show "Waiting for review"
3. Click **Review deployments** → select `prod` → **Approve**
4. The workflow publishes the matching `@opengsd/engine-*` packages, verifies they are visible on npm, publishes `@opengsd/gsd-pi@latest`, pushes the release commit/tag, and creates a GitHub Release

To enable live LLM tests during Prod promotion:
- Set the `RUN_LIVE_TESTS` environment variable to `true` on the `prod` environment

### Rolling Back a Release

If a broken version reaches production:

```bash
# Roll back npm
npm dist-tag add @opengsd/gsd-pi@<previous-good-version> latest

# Roll back Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/open-gsd/gsd-pi:<previous-good-version>
docker tag ghcr.io/open-gsd/gsd-pi:<previous-good-version> ghcr.io/open-gsd/gsd-pi:latest
docker push ghcr.io/open-gsd/gsd-pi:latest
```

For `@dev` or `@next` rollbacks, the next successful merge will overwrite the tag automatically.

### GitHub Configuration Required

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| npm Trusted Publisher workflow filename | `npm-publish.yml` (for `@opengsd/gsd-pi` only) |
| Environment: `dev` | No protection rules |
| Environment: `test` | No protection rules |
| Environment: `prod` | Required reviewers: maintainers |
| Secret: `NPM_TOKEN` | Not required for trusted publishing; set for token-fallback bootstrap/manual native publishes (`publish_auth=token`) |
| Secret: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Prod environment only |
| Secret: `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Prod environment only |
| Variable: `RUN_LIVE_TESTS` | `false` (set to `true` to enable live LLM tests) |
| GHCR | Enabled for the `open-gsd` org |

### npm Trusted Publishing (all packages)

npm [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) binds each package to a single GitHub Actions workflow filename. It can only be configured **after** a package already exists on npm — you cannot set it up for packages that return 404.

#### First-time packages (bootstrap with token)

Use this when any `@opengsd/engine-*` package is missing from npm (today: `@opengsd/engine-darwin-x64`, `@opengsd/engine-linux-x64-gnu`).

1. Create an npm [automation token](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/opengsd/tokens) with **Publish** access to the `@opengsd` scope (must be allowed to create new packages under the org).
2. Add the token as repository secret **`NPM_TOKEN`** (GitHub → repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions).
3. Run [Build Native Binaries](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-pi/actions/workflows/build-native.yml):
   - `publish`: **true**
   - `platform_packages_only`: **true**
   - `publish_auth`: **token** ← required for packages that do not exist yet
4. Confirm all five packages resolve: `npm view @opengsd/engine-darwin-x64 version` (and the other four).
5. **Then** configure trusted publishing on each package (table below).
6. Re-run **NPM Publish** with the desired channel.

The publish step skips packages already on npm and attempts all five platforms before failing, so one error does not leave the rest unpublished.

#### Trusted publishing (after first publish)

Configure **every** package on [npm package settings](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/opengsd/packages) → package → **Publishing access** → **Trusted Publisher**:

| npm package | Trusted Publisher workflow |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| `@opengsd/gsd-pi` | `npm-publish.yml` |
| `@opengsd/engine-darwin-arm64` | `npm-publish.yml` |
| `@opengsd/engine-darwin-x64` | `npm-publish.yml` |
| `@opengsd/engine-linux-x64-gnu` | `npm-publish.yml` |
| `@opengsd/engine-linux-arm64-gnu` | `npm-publish.yml` |
| `@opengsd/engine-win32-x64-msvc` | `npm-publish.yml` |

For all packages: repository **`open-gsd/gsd-pi`**, environment **(none)**.

After trusted publishing is configured, use **NPM Publish** with `channel=latest` and `publish_auth=trusted` (default) for routine production publishes. The standalone **Build Native Binaries** workflow remains useful for manual binary builds and token-based bootstrap publishes, but trusted production native package publishing belongs to `npm-publish.yml` so the prod workflow can publish a single coherent version end to end.

### Docker Images

| Image | Base | Purpose | Tags |
|-------|------|---------|------|
| `ghcr.io/open-gsd/gsd-ci-builder` | `node:24-bookworm` | CI build environment with Rust toolchain | `:latest`, `:<date>` |
| `ghcr.io/open-gsd/gsd-pi` | `node:24-slim` | User-facing runtime | `:latest`, `:next`, `:v<version>` |

The CI builder image is rebuilt automatically when its build inputs change. It eliminates ~3-5 min of toolchain setup per CI run.

## LLM Fixture Tests

The fixture system records and replays LLM conversations without hitting real APIs (zero cost).

### Running Fixture Tests

```bash
npm run test:fixtures
```

### Recording New Fixtures

```bash
# Set your API key, then record
GSD_FIXTURE_MODE=record GSD_FIXTURE_DIR=./tests/fixtures/recordings \
  node --experimental-strip-types tests/fixtures/record.ts
```

Fixtures are JSON files in `tests/fixtures/recordings/`. Each one captures a conversation's request/response pairs and replays them by turn index.

### When to Re-Record

Re-record fixtures when:
- Provider wire format changes (e.g., new field in Anthropic response)
- Tool definitions change (affects request shape)
- System prompt changes (may cause turn count mismatch)

## Version Strategy

| Tag | Published | Format | Who uses it |
|-----|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `@dev` | Every merged PR | `2.27.0-dev.a3f2c1b` | Developers verifying fixes |
| `@next` | Auto-promoted from dev | Same version | Early adopters, beta testers |
| `@latest` | Manually approved | Same version | Production users |

Old `-dev.` versions are cleaned up weekly (30-day retention).
