# ADR-041: Engine Hook Contract

## Status

Accepted (2026-06-12)

## Context

Under the external claude-code-cli engine, `tool_call`/`tool_result` hooks never fire — the engine pre-executes tools, so `prepareToolCall`'s `externalResult` branch returns before `beforeToolCall` and skips the `afterToolCall` finalization. Only `tool_execution_start`/`tool_execution_end` are emitted unconditionally (agent-loop, both sequential and parallel paths). This load-bearing fact lived in one inline comment; enforcement placed on the wrong hook is silently dead on one engine class. Three tool-name normalizers coexisted (`canonicalToolName` prefix-strip, `canonicalWorkflowToolName` prefix-strip + alias, and a hand-rolled `canonicalHeadlessToolName`), and callers had to just know which to pick.

## Decision

`engine-hook-contract.ts` declares the verified fire matrix as typed constants:

- `UNIVERSAL_TOOL_HOOKS = ["tool_execution_start", "tool_execution_end"]` — emitted unconditionally in `packages/pi-agent-core/src/agent-loop.ts`.
- `NATIVE_ONLY_TOOL_HOOKS = ["tool_call", "tool_result"]` — wired to `beforeToolCall`/`afterToolCall` in `packages/gsd-agent-core/src/session/agent-session-extensions.ts`; skipped by the `externalResult` short-circuit.
- Non-tool events (session_*, agent_end, message_update, …) are deliberately unclassified — only verified guarantees are declared.
- The module is the normalizer seam: it re-exports `canonicalToolName` (MCP prefix strip — use for raw hook tool names) and `canonicalWorkflowToolName` (strip + workflow alias resolution — use for workflow-surface membership), with doc comments saying which to use when. `canonicalHeadlessToolName` delegates to the shared strip (divergence existed only on malformed names that cannot match real tools; pinned by a parity test).
- Every tool-hook registration in `register-hooks.ts` carries a contract-referencing comment stating its guarantee. This change is behavior-neutral: no enforcement moved between hooks.

## Consequences

- "Does this fire under claude-code-cli?" is answered at import time; a new engine updates one contract.
- Recorded follow-up (not fixed here): nine `tool_call`-only guards have no `tool_execution_start` mirror and are silently dead under external engines — loop guard, deferred approval-gate block, pending-gate blocking, queue-mode execution guard, planning-unit tools-policy, worktree-isolation write gate, STATE.md single-writer blocks, context-write depth gate, and the destructive-command hard gate (the last is structurally impossible to mirror post-execution). Mirroring or pre-execution alternatives need their own design pass.
- Complements ADR-036 (Tool Surface Readiness): same spirit, applied to the hook surface instead of the tool surface.
