# Architecture Overview

GSD is a TypeScript application built on the [Pi SDK](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). It embeds the Pi coding agent and extends it with the GSD workflow engine, auto mode state machine, and project management primitives.

## System Structure

```
gsd (CLI binary)
  └─ loader.ts          Sets PI_PACKAGE_DIR, GSD env vars, dynamic-imports cli.ts
      └─ cli.ts         Wires SDK managers, loads extensions, starts InteractiveMode
          ├─ onboarding.ts   First-run setup wizard (LLM provider + tool keys)
          ├─ wizard.ts       Env hydration from stored auth.json credentials
          ├─ app-paths.ts    ~/.gsd/agent/, ~/.gsd/sessions/, auth.json
          ├─ resource-loader.ts  Syncs managed resources to ~/.gsd/agent/
          └─ src/resources/
              ├─ extensions/gsd/    Core GSD extension
              ├─ extensions/...     22 supporting extensions
              ├─ agents/            scout, researcher, worker
              ├─ AGENTS.md          Agent routing instructions
              └─ GSD-WORKFLOW.md    Manual bootstrap protocol

gsd headless              Headless mode — CI/cron orchestration via RPC child process
gsd --mode mcp            MCP server mode — exposes tools over stdin/stdout

vscode-extension/         VS Code extension — chat participant (@gsd), sidebar dashboard, RPC integration
```

## Key Design Decisions

### DB-Authoritative Project State

GSD stores runtime workflow state in the project-root SQLite database. Auto mode derives phases, completion status, requirements, decisions, summaries, and hierarchy from that database, then renders markdown projections in `.gsd/` for human review, prompt context, and git-friendly history. No in-memory state survives across sessions. This enables crash recovery, multi-terminal steering, and session resumption while avoiding silent markdown re-imports during normal runtime.

Milestone queue position has one explicit file contract: `.gsd/QUEUE-ORDER.json`. `/gsd rethink` and `/gsd phase` use it as a durable reorder record, and state derivation mirrors that order into `milestones.sequence` before selecting the active milestone. Other generated `.gsd` artifacts remain projections unless an explicit import or recovery command reads them.

### Two-File Loader Pattern

`loader.ts` sets all environment variables with zero SDK imports, then dynamically imports `cli.ts` which does static SDK imports. This ensures `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` is set before any SDK code evaluates.

### `pkg/` Shim Directory

`PI_PACKAGE_DIR` points to `pkg/` (not project root) to avoid Pi's theme resolution colliding with GSD's `src/` directory. Contains only `piConfig` and theme assets.

### Managed Resource Sync

Bundled extensions, shared files, agents, and skills are synced to
`~/.gsd/agent/` on launch when the managed-resource manifest or content
fingerprint is stale. The `gsd-browser` skill is then overlaid from the
installed `@opengsd/gsd-browser` package, including package-relative support
files, so browser automation guidance tracks the browser package instead of a
duplicated Pi copy.

### Lazy Provider Loading

LLM provider SDKs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) are lazy-loaded on first use rather than imported at startup. This significantly reduces cold-start time — only the provider you actually connect to gets loaded.

### Fresh Session Per Unit

Every dispatch creates a new agent session. The LLM starts with a clean context window containing only the pre-inlined artifacts it needs. This prevents quality degradation from context accumulation.

### Workspace Roots, Not Ambient `cwd`

GSD workflow code must treat the active project/worktree as explicit state, not infer it from ambient `process.cwd()`. Prefer `AutoSession.scope`, `s.canonicalProjectRoot`, `s.basePath`, `s.originalBasePath`, hook `ctx.cwd`, or an explicit `basePath` parameter depending on the boundary. `cwd` remains valid as a subprocess/shell option in generic Pi tooling, but GSD identity, DB paths, workflow gates, auto-mode sessions, and dynamic tool execution should be rooted from explicit workflow state.

## Bundled Extensions

| Extension | What It Provides |
|-----------|-----------------|

| **Researcher** | Web research — finds and synthesizes current information |
| **Worker** | General-purpose execution in an isolated context window |

## Native Engine

Performance-critical operations use a Rust N-API engine:

- **grep** — ripgrep-backed content search
- **glob** — gitignore-aware file discovery
- **ps** — cross-platform process tree management
- **highlight** — syntect-based syntax highlighting
- **ast** — structural code search via ast-grep
- **diff** — fuzzy text matching and unified diff generation
- **text** — ANSI-aware text measurement and wrapping
- **html** — HTML-to-Markdown conversion
- **image** — decode, encode, resize images
- **fd** — fuzzy file path discovery
- **clipboard** — native clipboard access
- **git** — libgit2-backed git read operations
- **parser** — GSD file parsing and frontmatter extraction

## Dispatch Pipeline

The auto-loop is a **linear** pipeline (`auto/loop.ts`), the replacement for the older recursive `dispatchNextUnit → resolveAgentEnd → dispatchNextUnit` chain. Each iteration flows through explicit stages (see [auto-mode.md](../user-docs/auto-mode.md) for the full description):

```
1. Pre-Dispatch  — derive state, run UOK guards, resolve model preferences, check captures
2. Dispatch      — build the prompt and execute the unit with the selected model
3. Post-Unit     — close out the unit, snapshot metrics, verify artifacts, persist state
4. Finalize      — milestone/slice completion and projection
5. Loop          — advance to the next unit
```

Model routing (complexity classification, budget pressure, routing history, capability scoring) is folded into the Pre-Dispatch stage via `auto-model-selection.ts` (`selectAndApplyModel`), not handled as standalone pipeline steps. Phase skipping (from a token profile) gates which unit types are dispatched.

## Key Modules

> The auto-mode kernel lives under the `auto/` subdirectory (`auto/orchestrator.ts`, `auto/loop.ts`, `auto/phases.ts`, `auto/pre-dispatch.ts`, `auto/dispatch.ts`, `auto/finalize.ts`, `auto/detect-stuck.ts`, `auto/dispatch-key.ts`, `auto/dispatch-history.ts`, and `workflow-kernel.ts`). Pre-dispatch invariants are enforced by the `uok/` deep module (`uok/flags.ts`, `uok/gate-runner.ts`) wired into the orchestrator. The flat `auto-*.ts` modules below are the older, surrounding surface.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `auto.ts` | Auto-mode state machine and orchestration |
| `auto/session.ts` | `AutoSession` class — all mutable auto-mode state in one encapsulated instance |
| `auto-dispatch.ts` | Declarative dispatch table (phase → unit mapping) |
| `auto/dispatch-key.ts` | Completed-key checks, skip loop detection, key eviction |
| `auto/detect-stuck.ts` | Stuck loop recovery and unit retry escalation |
| `auto-start.ts` | Fresh-start bootstrap — git/state init, crash lock detection, worktree setup |
| `auto-post-unit.ts` | Post-unit processing — commit, doctor, state rebuild, hooks |
| `auto-verification.ts` | Post-unit verification gate (lint/test/typecheck with auto-fix retries) |
| `auto-prompts.ts` | Prompt builders with inline level compression |
| `worktree-lifecycle.ts` | Worktree Lifecycle module — enter, exit, merge guard ordering, teardown, and session root mutation |
| `milestone-merge-transaction.ts` | Milestone Merge Transaction module — production adapter that wraps the legacy merge primitive behind the Lifecycle runner seam |
| `auto-worktree.ts` | Lower-level worktree helpers and inner milestone merge primitive consumed through the default transaction adapter |
| `auto-recovery.ts` | Expected artifact resolution, completed-key persistence, self-healing |

| `complexity-classifier.ts` | Unit complexity classification (light/standard/heavy) |
| `model-router.ts` | Dynamic model routing with cost-aware selection |
| `model-cost-table.ts` | Built-in per-model cost data for cross-provider comparison |
| `routing-history.ts` | Adaptive learning from routing outcomes |

| `guidance.ts` | Single catalog mapping typed findings (recovery kinds, milestone blockers, doctor issue codes, crash unit classes) to user-facing remediation prose |
