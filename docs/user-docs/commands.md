## Visual Briefs

`/gsd brief` asks the agent to gather evidence and write a single responsive HTML artifact for visual review, planning, recap, or presentation. Usage:

```text
/gsd brief <diagram|plan|diff|recap|table|slides> [topic] [--slides]
```

Modes:

| Mode | Use it for |
|------|------------|
| `diagram` | System, architecture, flow, state, data, or process diagrams. If the first argument is not a known mode, GSD treats the whole request as a diagram topic. |
| `plan` | Visual implementation plans with scope, likely files, edge cases, risks, and tests. |
| `diff` | Visual reviews of current staged and unstaged repository changes. If no topic is supplied, it reviews the current repository changes. |
| `recap` | Context-switching project recaps. If no topic is supplied, it recaps the current project. |
| `table` | Dense comparisons, audits, matrices, and status reports as readable HTML tables. |
| `slides` | A concise visual deck. Passing `--slides` with another mode also requests slide-deck output. |

Artifacts are written under the GSD agent directory's `diagrams/` folder with a descriptive kebab-case `.html` filename. The generated file is self-contained with embedded CSS and minimal JavaScript; it may use CDN libraries such as Mermaid for diagrams, but must keep useful written context if a CDN fails.

After writing the file, GSD attempts to open it in a browser using the local platform opener (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, or `cmd /c start` on Windows). If browser opening is unavailable or fails, the command reports the absolute file path.

## Configuration & Diagnostics

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd prefs` | Model selection, timeouts, budget ceiling |
| `/gsd model` | Switch the active session model or open a picker |
| `/gsd mode` | Switch workflow mode (solo/team) with coordinated defaults for milestone IDs, git commit behavior, and documentation |

| `/gsd keys` | API key manager — list, add, remove, test, rotate, doctor |
| `/gsd doctor` | Runtime health checks with auto-fix — issues surface in real time across widget, visualizer, and HTML reports |
| `/gsd inspect` | Show SQLite DB diagnostics |
| `/gsd show-config` | Show effective configuration, including models, routing, and toggles |
| `/gsd init` | Project init wizard — detect, configure, bootstrap `.gsd/`; if `.gsd/` already exists, opens an "Already Initialized" menu with `Re-configure preferences`, `Suggest & install skills`, or `Cancel` |
| `/gsd setup` | Global setup status and configuration |
| `/gsd onboarding` | Re-run the setup wizard (`--resume`, `--reset`, `--step <name>`) |
| `/gsd mcp` | Manage MCP servers (`status`, `check`, `discover`, `test`, `enable`, `disable`, `import`, `delete`, `init`) |
| `/gsd context` | Show a context breakdown chart for skills, injections, history, and MCP tool schema usage |

| `/gsd rebuild markdown` | Rebuild markdown projections from the canonical database; stale completion projections are quarantined, not imported |
| `/gsd rebuild database` | Reserved for DB-native rebuilds; does not import markdown projections |
| `/gsd language <language\|off\|clear>` | Set or clear the global response language |

## Milestone Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd new-project [--deep]` | Bootstrap a new project; `--deep` enables staged project-level discovery |
| `/gsd new-milestone [--deep]` | Create a new milestone; `--deep` opts the project into deep planning mode |
| `/gsd skip` | Prevent a unit from auto-mode dispatch |
| `/gsd undo` | Revert last completed unit |
| `/gsd undo-task` | Reset a specific task's completion state (DB + markdown) |
| `/gsd reset-slice` | Reset a slice and all its tasks (DB + markdown) |
| `/gsd park` | Park a milestone — skip without deleting |
| `/gsd unpark` | Reactivate a parked milestone |
| `/gsd rethink` | Conversational project reorganization — reorder, park, discard, or add milestones |
| Discard milestone | Available via `/gsd` wizard → "Milestone actions" → "Discard" |

Milestone and slice titles created during planning must not contain forward slash (`/`), en dash, or em dash characters. GSD reserves those characters as state-document delimiters, so `plan-milestone` rejects titles that include them.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd start` | Start a workflow template (bugfix, spike, feature, hotfix, refactor, security-audit, dep-upgrade, full-project) |
| `/gsd start resume` | Resume an in-progress workflow |
| `/gsd templates` | List available workflow templates |
| `/gsd templates info <name>` | Show detailed template info |

## Custom Workflows

The unified plugin system. Every workflow — bundled, user-authored, or
remotely installed — is discoverable via `/gsd workflow <name>` and declares
one of four execution modes:

| Mode              | What it does                                                                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `oneshot`         | Prompt-only, no state, no branch. For reviews, triage, changelog generation.              |
| `yaml-step`       | Full engine with GRAPH.yaml, iterate, and shell-verify. For fan-out batch work.           |
| `markdown-phase`  | Multi-phase with STATE.json + phase-approval gates. For release, performance audit.       |
| `auto-milestone`  | Hooks into the full `/gsd auto` pipeline. Reserved for `full-project`.                    |

### Discovery order (project > global > bundled)

1. `.gsd/workflows/<name>.{yaml,md}` — project-local, checked into the repo.
2. `~/.gsd/workflows/<name>.{yaml,md}` — global, private to the machine.
3. Bundled — ships with GSD (see the full list with `/gsd workflow`).

Legacy `.gsd/workflow-defs/` YAML definitions are still picked up for
backwards compatibility.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd workflow` | List all discoverable plugins, grouped by mode |
| `/gsd workflow <name> [args]` | Run a plugin directly (resolved via precedence chain) |
| `/gsd workflow info <name>` | Show plugin metadata — source, mode, phases, path |
| `/gsd workflow new` | Create a new workflow definition (via the `create-workflow` skill) |
| `/gsd workflow install <source>` | Install a plugin from `https://...`, `gist:<id>`, or `gh:owner/repo/path[@ref]` |
| `/gsd workflow uninstall <name>` | Remove an installed plugin and its provenance record |
| `/gsd workflow run <name> [k=v]` | Explicit YAML run form (same as `/gsd workflow <name>` for yaml-step plugins) |
| `/gsd workflow list` | List YAML workflow runs (history) |
| `/gsd workflow validate <name>` | Validate a YAML definition |
| `/gsd workflow pause` | Pause custom workflow auto-mode |
| `/gsd workflow resume` | Resume paused custom workflow auto-mode |

### Bundled plugins

- **Phased (`markdown-phase`)**: `bugfix`, `small-feature`, `spike`, `hotfix`,
  `refactor`, `security-audit`, `dep-upgrade`, `release`, `api-breaking-change`,
  `performance-audit`, `observability-setup`, `ci-bootstrap`.
- **Oneshot**: `pr-review`, `changelog-gen`, `issue-triage`, `pr-triage`,
  `onboarding-check`, `dead-code`, `accessibility-audit`.
- **YAML engine (`yaml-step`)**: `test-backfill`, `docs-sync`, `rename-symbol`,
  `env-audit`.
- **Auto-milestone**: `full-project` (reached via `/gsd start full-project` or
  `/gsd auto`).

### Authoring a custom plugin

Run `/gsd workflow new <name>` to scaffold via the `create-workflow` skill.
Plugins are plain YAML (`.yaml`) or markdown (`.md`) files. See
`src/resources/extensions/gsd/workflow-templates/` for bundled examples.

## Extensions

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd extensions list` | List all extensions and their status. User-installed entries show `[user]` plus the install source |
| `/gsd extensions enable <id>` | Enable a disabled extension |
| `/gsd extensions disable <id>` | Disable an extension |
| `/gsd extensions info <id>` | Show extension details |
| `/gsd extensions install <spec>` | Install a user extension. `<spec>` is an npm package, a git URL, or a local path. Restart GSD to activate. |
| `/gsd extensions uninstall <id>` | Remove a user-installed extension. Warns if other extensions depend on it. |
| `/gsd extensions update [id]` | Update a single user-installed npm extension to its latest version, or all of them when `id` is omitted. Git/local installs are skipped — reinstall to update. |
| `/gsd extensions validate <path>` | Validate an extension package directory against the manifest schema before publishing or installing. |

Install sources are auto-detected: starts with `http(s)://` or ends with `.git` → git clone; contains `/` or `.` and exists on disk → local copy; otherwise → `npm pack`. Installed extensions land in `~/.gsd/extensions/<id>/` and the registry records the source so `update` can re-fetch.

## cmux Integration

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd cmux status` | Show cmux detection, prefs, and capabilities |
| `/gsd cmux on` | Enable cmux integration |
| `/gsd cmux off` | Disable cmux integration |
| `/gsd cmux notifications on/off` | Toggle cmux desktop notifications |
| `/gsd cmux sidebar on/off` | Toggle cmux sidebar metadata |
| `/gsd cmux splits on/off` | Toggle cmux visual subagent splits |

## Subagents

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/subagent` | List available user and project subagents. Run records, status checks, and follow-up resume are handled through the `subagent` tool; see [Subagents](./subagents.md). |

## GitHub Sync

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/github-sync bootstrap` | Initial setup — creates GitHub Milestones, Issues, and draft PRs from current `.gsd/` state |
| `/github-sync status` | Show sync mapping counts (milestones, slices, tasks) |

Enable with `github.enabled: true` in preferences. Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated. Sync mapping is persisted in `.gsd/github-sync.json`.

## Git Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/worktree` (`/wt`) | Git worktree lifecycle — create, switch, merge, remove |

## GSD Worktree Commands

Use `/gsd worktree` from an active TUI session to inspect and clean up GSD-managed worktrees without leaving the conversation. `/gsd wt` is an alias.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gsd worktree list` | Show each worktree, branch, path, clean/unmerged/uncommitted status, diff stats, and commit count. Alias: `/gsd worktree ls`. |
| `/gsd worktree merge [name]` | Merge a worktree into the detected main branch, then remove the worktree and its branch. The name is optional only when exactly one worktree exists. |
| `/gsd worktree clean` | Remove only merged or empty worktrees. Worktrees with unmerged diffs or uncommitted changes are kept. |
| `/gsd worktree remove <name> [--force]` | Remove a named worktree and delete its branch. Refuses unmerged or uncommitted work unless `--force` is supplied. Alias: `/gsd worktree rm`. |

Safety behavior:

- `merge` auto-commits dirty worktree changes before merging when possible.
- `merge` refuses to continue if the project root is not on the detected main branch; check out the main branch and rerun it.
- `clean` never deletes worktrees with pending file changes.
- `remove` requires `--force` to discard unmerged or uncommitted work.

## Telegram Commands

The following commands are sent directly in your **Telegram chat** to a configured GSD bot — they are not GSD CLI commands. Telegram command polling runs every ~5 seconds while auto-mode is active. Each response is prefixed with the project name (e.g., `📁 MyProject`).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Current milestone, active unit, and session cost |
| `/progress` | Roadmap overview — completed and open milestones |
| `/budget` | Token usage and cost for the current session |
| `/pause` | Pause auto-mode after the current unit finishes |
| `/resume` | Clear a pause directive and continue auto-mode |
| `/log [n]` | Last `n` activity log entries (default: 5) |
| `/help` | List all available Telegram commands |

**Requirements:** Telegram must be configured as your remote channel (`remote_questions.channel: telegram`). Commands are only processed while auto-mode is running. See [Remote Questions — Telegram Commands](./remote-questions.md#telegram-commands) for setup and details.

## Session Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/clear` | Start a new session (alias for `/new`) |
| `/exit` | Graceful shutdown — saves session state before exiting |
| `/kill` | Kill GSD process immediately |
| `/model` | Switch the active model |
| `/login` | Log in to an LLM provider |
| `/thinking` | Toggle thinking level during sessions |
| `/voice` | Toggle real-time speech-to-text (macOS, Linux) |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Alt+G` | Toggle dashboard overlay |
| `Ctrl+Alt+V` | Toggle voice transcription |
| `Ctrl+Alt+B` | Show background shell processes |
| `Ctrl+V` / `Alt+V` | Paste image from clipboard (screenshot → vision input) |
| `Escape` | Pause auto mode (preserves conversation) |

> **Note:** In terminals without Kitty keyboard protocol support (macOS Terminal.app, JetBrains IDEs), slash-command fallbacks are shown instead of `Ctrl+Alt` shortcuts.
>
> **Tip:** If `Ctrl+V` is intercepted by your terminal (e.g. Warp), use `Alt+V` instead for clipboard image paste.

### Claude Code selected-text Quick Action (macOS)

`scripts/claude-code-send-selection.sh` is an optional Automator Quick Action shim for Claude Code.app. It reads selected text from stdin (or the clipboard as a fallback), pastes it into Claude Code, submits it, and restores the previous clipboard. To use it, create an Automator **Quick Action** with **Run Shell Script**, point it at the script path, and bind your preferred macOS keyboard shortcut.

## CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gsd` | Start a new interactive session |
| `gsd --continue` (`-c`) | Resume the most recent session for the current directory |
| `gsd --model <id>` | Override the default model for this session |

| `gsd --list-models [search]` | List available models and exit |
| `gsd --web [path]` | Start browser-based web interface (optional project path) |
| `gsd --worktree` (`-w`) [name] | Start session in a git worktree (auto-generates name if omitted) |
| `gsd --no-session` | Disable session persistence |
| `gsd --extension <path>` | Load an additional extension (can be repeated) |
| `gsd --append-system-prompt <text>` | Append text to the system prompt |
| `gsd --tools <list>` | Comma-separated list of tools to enable |
| `gsd --version` (`-v`) | Print version and exit |
| `gsd --help` (`-h`) | Print help and exit |
| `gsd sessions` | Interactive session picker — list all saved sessions for the current directory and choose one to resume |
| `gsd config` | Set up global API keys for search and docs tools (saved to `~/.gsd/agent/auth.json`, applies to all projects). See [Global API Keys](./configuration.md#global-api-keys-gsd-config). |
| `gsd update` | Update GSD to the latest version (use `gsd update browser` to update the managed browser) |
| `gsd install <source>` | Install an extension from npm, git, a URL, or a local path (e.g. `gsd install npm:@foo/bar`) |
| `gsd remove <source>` | Remove a previously installed extension |
| `gsd list` | List installed extensions |
| `gsd graph <subcommand>` | Build, query, status, or diff the project knowledge graph built from `.gsd/` artifacts |
| `gsd headless --json` | Structured JSONL event stream to stdout for scripting, CI, and troubleshooting (alias: `--output-format stream-json`) |
| `gsd headless new-milestone` | Create a new milestone from a context file (headless — no TUI required) |

## Headless Mode

`gsd headless` runs `/gsd` commands without a TUI — designed for CI, cron jobs, and scripted automation. It spawns a child process in RPC mode, auto-responds to interactive prompts, detects completion, and exits with meaningful exit codes.

```bash
# Run auto mode (default)
gsd headless

# Run a single unit
gsd headless next

# Instant JSON snapshot — no LLM, ~50ms
gsd headless query

# With timeout for CI
gsd headless --timeout 600000 auto

# Force a specific phase
gsd headless dispatch plan

# Create a new milestone from a context file and start auto mode
gsd headless new-milestone --context brief.md --auto

# Create a milestone from inline text
gsd headless new-milestone --context-text "Build a REST API with auth"

# Pipe context from stdin
echo "Build a CLI tool" | gsd headless new-milestone --context -
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--timeout N` | Overall timeout in milliseconds (default: 300000 / 5 min) |
| `--max-restarts N` | Auto-restart on crash with exponential backoff (default: 3). Set 0 to disable. Deterministic no-work failures are not restart-eligible. |
| `--json` | Stream all events as JSONL to stdout |
| `--model ID` | Override the model for the headless session |
| `--context <file>` | Context file for `new-milestone` (use `-` for stdin) |
| `--context-text <text>` | Inline context text for `new-milestone` |
| `--auto` | Chain into auto-mode after milestone creation |

**Exit codes:** `0` = complete, `1` = error or timeout, `2` = blocked.

In JSON output summaries, headless can also return `status: "no-work-deterministic"` for repeatable no-progress tails (for example select → input → cancelled). This status exits with code `1` and suppresses automatic restart loops.

Any `/gsd` subcommand works as a positional argument — `gsd headless status`, `gsd headless doctor`, `gsd headless dispatch execute`, etc.

### `gsd headless recover`

Non-TTY equivalent of `/gsd recover --confirm` — resets the DB hierarchy plus persisted validation and quality-gate state, then reconstructs from rendered markdown. Designed for CI, cron, and any environment where the interactive recover prompt cannot run.

```bash
gsd headless recover
```

Exits non-zero if recovery fails. Pair with `gsd headless query` afterwards to verify the rebuilt state.

### `gsd headless query`

Returns a single JSON object with the full project snapshot — no LLM session, no RPC child, instant response (~50ms). This is the recommended way for orchestrators and scripts to inspect GSD state.

```bash
gsd headless query | jq '.state.phase'
# "executing"

gsd headless query | jq '.next'
# {"action":"dispatch","unitType":"execute-task","unitId":"M001/S01/T03"}

gsd headless query | jq '.cost.total'
# 4.25
```

**Output schema:**

```json
{
  "state": {
    "phase": "executing",
    "activeMilestone": { "id": "M001", "title": "..." },
    "activeSlice": { "id": "S01", "title": "..." },
    "activeTask": { "id": "T01", "title": "..." },
    "registry": [{ "id": "M001", "status": "active" }, ...],
    "progress": { "milestones": { "done": 0, "total": 2 }, "slices": { "done": 1, "total": 3 } },
    "blockers": []
  },
  "next": {
    "action": "dispatch",
    "unitType": "execute-task",
    "unitId": "M001/S01/T01"
  },
  "cost": {
    "workers": [{ "milestoneId": "M001", "cost": 1.50, "state": "running", ... }],
    "total": 1.50
  }
}
```

## MCP Server Mode

`gsd --mode mcp` runs GSD as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server over stdin/stdout. This exposes all GSD tools (read, write, edit, bash, etc.) to external AI clients — Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, and any MCP-compatible host.

```bash
# Start GSD as an MCP server
gsd --mode mcp
```

The server registers all tools from the agent session and maps MCP `tools/list` and `tools/call` requests to GSD tool definitions. It runs until the transport closes.

## Cloud MCP Gateway Runtime

`gsd-cloud-mcp-gateway` starts an HTTP gateway for remote MCP clients. `gsd-daemon cloud` pairs and connects a local runtime to that gateway.

```bash
GSD_CLOUD_USER_TOKEN="replace-with-a-long-random-token" gsd-cloud-mcp-gateway --port 8787
gsd-daemon cloud status
gsd-daemon cloud pair --gateway "https://gateway.example.com" --code "PAIRING_CODE" --runtime-name "Laptop"
gsd-daemon cloud connect --verbose
gsd-daemon cloud disconnect
```

See [Cloud MCP Gateway](./cloud-mcp-gateway.md) for the full operator setup flow, token model, ports, and failure modes.

## In-Session Update

`/gsd update` checks npm for a newer version of GSD and installs it without leaving the session.
When the `claude-code` provider is configured, update may also warn if the local Claude Code Runtime is below the GSD release's validated floor.

```bash
/gsd update
# Current version: 1.2.0
# Checking npm registry...
# Updated to 1.3.0. Restart GSD to use the new version.
```

If already up to date, it reports so and takes no action.

## Report

`/gsd report` generates HTML reports for all milestones and opens the reports index in a browser. `/gsd export` remains available as an alias.

```bash
# Generate all missing milestone reports and open the reports index
/gsd report

# Generate HTML report for the active milestone
/gsd report --html

# Generate retrospective reports for ALL milestones at once
/gsd report --html --all
```

Reports are saved to `.gsd/reports/` with a browseable `index.html` that links to all generated snapshots. Each report includes the active memory feed in its Knowledge section when memory rows are available.
