# Switching between gsd-core and gsd-pi

Both `@opengsd/gsd-core` and `@opengsd/gsd-pi` read and write the same `.gsd/` directory. You can open a project in either tool, switch freely, and even interleave them across sessions. This doc explains the workflow and what to do when the two tools disagree.

## The shared contract

`.gsd/*.md` files are the contract between the two tools. gsd-core treats them as the source of truth. gsd-pi uses a SQLite DB internally (faster queries, transactional state) but projects to the same `.md` files and imports external edits on startup. For status checkboxes, gsd-pi treats only the drifted file's recorded milestone entities as markdown-authoritative; unrelated stale projections keep the DB status.

## Recommended workflow: commit before switching

Git is the integration layer. Before switching tools, commit:

```bash
git add .gsd/
git commit -m "wip: switching to gsd-pi"
```

Then open the other tool. If anything goes wrong, `git reset --hard` restores the pre-switch state. This is the simplest and safest workflow.

## What gsd-pi does on startup

When you open a project in gsd-pi, it runs a reconciliation pass that:

1. Compares every `.gsd/*.md` file against its recorded baseline in `.gsd/.compat.json`.
2. Imports any file that changed since the last gsd-pi session (e.g., gsd-core edits), with status changes scoped to the milestone entities recorded for that drifted file.
3. Re-projects all markdown from the DB.
4. Updates `.gsd/.compat.json` with the new baseline.

This is automatic — you don't need to do anything special. gsd-pi will not silently overwrite gsd-core edits.

## `/gsd sync` — mid-session switch

If you switch tools while gsd-pi is running (e.g., a teammate edits `.gsd/plan.md` via gsd-core and pushes), run:

```
/gsd sync
```

This re-runs the reconciliation pipeline, imports the external edits, and re-projects. Use `--dry-run` to preview what would change:

```
/gsd sync --dry-run
```

## `/gsd doctor` — check compat health

`/gsd doctor` includes a compat-health line that tells you whether the marker is present and whether any files have drifted:

```
Compat health:      OK
```

or

```
Compat health:      2 file(s) drifted — run /gsd sync
```

## What gsd-core sees

gsd-core is unaware of gsd-pi. It sees `.gsd/*.md` as ordinary markdown and edits them directly. gsd-pi's `.gsd/.compat.json` and `gsd.db` files are ignored by gsd-core (it preserves unknown files, so they won't be deleted).

## `.planning/` projects

If your project uses gsd-core's `.planning/` layout (flat `phases/NN-name/` directories, root `ROADMAP.md` / `STATE.md`), gsd-pi projects DB state back to `.planning/` automatically — you don't need to run `/gsd migrate`.

- The first time gsd-pi sees a `.planning/` project, it records the layout in `.gsd/.compat.json` under `planning.layout`.
- On every projection, gsd-pi writes back to `.planning/` using that recorded layout.
- `/gsd sync` imports gsd-core's `.planning/` edits; `/gsd doctor` reports `.planning/` drift separately from `.gsd/` drift.

**Un-modeled docs** (phase `DISCUSSION-LOG.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `REVIEWS.md`, `codebase/`, `research/`) are pass-through: gsd-pi detects edits to them but never overwrites them. They are gsd-core-owned.

**v1 limitation:** only the `flat-phases` layout is supported for round-trip projection. `multi-milestone` and `legacy-milestone-dir` layouts will be supported after fixtures validate the reverse-mapping. For those layouts today, run `/gsd migrate` once to move to `.gsd/`.

## Conflicts: same entity edited in both

If both tools edit the *same* entity (e.g., both change the status of slice `S01`) between syncs, the last writer wins after the next reconcile, and gsd-pi surfaces the resolution in the `/gsd sync` output. If a different projection is stale but did not drift, its checkbox status is not allowed to reopen or close unrelated DB rows during the import. Git review remains the final safety net — that's why the "commit before switching" workflow matters.

## Troubleshooting

**`gsd doctor` says "no baseline"**: run `/gsd sync` once to establish the marker.

**`.gsd/.compat.json.bad-*` files appear**: gsd-pi quarantined a malformed marker and started fresh. Safe to delete the `.bad-*` file after reviewing it.

**`/gsd sync` reports drift every time you open the project**: this means gsd-pi's projection isn't idempotent — a real bug. The round-trip property test suite in CI catches most of these; report the fixture if you hit one in the wild.
